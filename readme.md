RFX Reworks is a resource pack in a semi-vanilla visual style for Minecraft 1.19.2. It modifies a number of sprites to be more interesting and flashy, with a bit of scifi flair; or just slightly more realistic.
It is designed for use with Optifine or [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized?hl=en-US), which I highly recommend.

A fair warning, the pack will end up slightly oversized and largely disorganized during development due to project files which I only remove at the end of each dev cycle. This should not have any other effects. I also welcome anybody who feels like it to peruse the project files and perhaps use them for your own projects. They are in the .kra format, an open-source storage format for the Krita art program.
If a project file you want is missing, I am happy to provide any of them by request.

Items contained in folders titled "Original" are original sprites from the source in question, and are in no way my own work. They are included temporarily as a progress log for the workspace as I design new sprites to replace them.
