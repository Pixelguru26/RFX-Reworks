RFX Reworks is a decorative scifi resource pack in a semi-vanilla visual style for Minecraft 1.19.2 and (modded) 1.12.2. It modifies a number of sprites to be more interesting and flashy, with a bit of scifi flair; or just slightly more realistic.
It is designed for use with Optifine or [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized?hl=en-US), which I highly recommend.

This project is effectively open source. I welcome anybody who feels like it to peruse the project files and perhaps use them for your own projects. They are in the .kra format, an open-source storage format for the Krita art program.
If a project file you want is missing, I am happy to provide any of them by request.

Items contained in folders titled "Original" are original sprites from the source in question, and are in no way my own work. They are included temporarily as a progress log for the workspace as I design new sprites to replace them. Removal of the source files is in progress, though scrap image files (but not kra project files) will remain in place.
